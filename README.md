# D3.JS-Aviation-Dashboard-Project
An interactive data visualisation project built with React + D3.js that demonstrates the power of data-driven insights in the aviation industry. This project was designed as part of my professional portfolio to showcase my skills in data visualization, dashboard design, and JavaScript development. Moreover, I was very interested in applying D3.js to compare it to other visualisation frameworks and packages that are available.
